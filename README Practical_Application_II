Summary:
For this exercise, I tried LASSO, Ridge and also Random Forest to evaluate the dataset, finding the mean square error value to determine which model performed best. 
Both LASSO and Ridge Regression performed decently with R2 score around 76.4%
I was able to predict the car pricing with the Ridge Regression, and I was amazed that some of the predicted price are very closed to the actual price. 
This was a great project to practice data cleaning and transformation, modeling, evaluation metrics, visualization by plots, founding the coefficient and permutation importance, predicting the pricing and interpret the result.
